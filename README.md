# Description

Check out this straightforward to-do app created using React JS. It helps you organize tasks efficiently with a clean and easy-to-use interface. Add, and delete tasks effortlessly for a hassle-free task management experience.

# How It Works

This application incorporates a convenient 'Add Task' feature, allowing users to seamlessly create new tasks. The tasks are displayed in a comprehensive list for easy reference. To manage and persist these tasks, the application utilizes the npm package 'json-server.' Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete, and completed tasks can be easily deleted. Thanks to the integration of 'json-server,' the app ensures data persistence, meaning that even if the page is refreshed, the exact to-do tasks, along with their complete or incomplete status, will be retained and displayed accurately.
